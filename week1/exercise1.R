# Correlation - strength of the linear association between two variables
# Residuals - leftovers from the model fit (diff between observed and predicted y)
# Least squares line - a measure for the best fit (minimize sum of squares of residuals)

# Conditions for linear regression
# 1. Linear relationship between x and y
# 2. Normal residuals
# 3. Constant variability
